                    <h1>HI, i'm chyna *◡*  </h1>
                    <p>I don’t have many photos that show my face completely—partly because I’m a shy person and partly because I’m very particular about what I share online. I’m not a coder, but I’m also not a quitter. My website might not be perfect, but it’s the result of my best efforts, guided by what I’ve learned and a lot of Bootstrap magic.</p>
                    <p>From a young age, my passion for art and drawing has always been a part of me. I was the kind of imaginative kid the kind that drew on the walls of their house (which I got scolded for it). Back then, I was also a huge anime and gaming nerd—interests that played a big role in shaping who I am today.

                        What started as a simple pastime—just me and my sketches—has grown into a full-fledged dream. That’s why I’m here now, studying BMA at FEU Tech, determined to carve my path as a game artist and bring my creative visions to life.</p>
                    <p>my favorite color is pink ♥</p>

Lately, most of my artworks revolve around two characters from a favorite ship—they’ve become my current muses and continue to fuel my creativity.</p>
